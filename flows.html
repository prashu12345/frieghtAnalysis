                    Two commodities exhibit particularly notable trends: Coal and Natural gas. The coal commodity shows a dramatic spike around 2022, surging to nearly 6000 Ktons, before plummeting just as sharply by 2025. Natural gas follows a similar, though less extreme, pattern with a sharp increase and decrease around the same timeframe. In contrast, the commodity of Waste/Scrap and other fossil products displays a steady increase over the entire period, rising gradually from 2018 to just over 5000 Ktons by 2050. The other commodities generally maintain a flat trend with minimal fluctuations in shipment weights. This graph offers insights into the volatile nature of certain commodities like Natural Gas and Coal, contrasting with the steadier growth of Waste/Scrap, highlighting the diverse dynamics within the shipping industry.

The graph shows significant fluctuations in shipment weights for several states. Maryland experiences a sharp peak around 2022, reaching close to 12K Ktons, before sharply declining and then stabilizing at a lower level. Similarly, Pennsylvania sees a significant rise to over 10K Ktons shortly after 2020, followed by a rapid drop. In contrast, West Virginia (54) exhibits the same trend as Pennsylvania. Other states represented on the graph, such as Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan, show relatively stable shipment weights throughout the forecasted period, indicating less volatility in their shipment activities compared to Maryland and Pennsylvania.
 </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>3.Total Weight of Shipments by Commodity and Year</strong><br>
                    A significant trend is visible in the commodity of Coal (code 15), which experiences a steep decline from approximately 20K Ktons in 2018 to about 10K Ktons by 2025 and continues to decrease steadily thereafter. This downward trend suggests a diminishing reliance on our production of coal over the forecasted period. Another noteworthy trend is observed in the Waste/Scrap commodity (code 41), which shows a brief peak around 2022 before stabilizing. The lines for Natural Gas and other fossil products and Motorized Vehicles (code 36) exhibit gradual decreases, indicating a steady reduction in their shipment weights. Other commodities such as Wood Products, Machinery, and Logs maintain relatively flat trends, suggesting consistent shipment volumes over the years.

 <p>
    <strong>4. Total Weight of Shipments by Foreign Destination and Year</strong><br>
    The data reveals significant fluctuations and trends across various global regions. Notably, shipments to Europe show a dramatic spike in 2022, peaking at around 7K Ktons, followed by a sharp decline and stabilization at approximately 4K Ktons by 2025. Eastern Asia exhibits similar but less pronounced spikes around the same time, suggesting a synchronized event or economic condition impacting these regions. Post-2025, the shipments to SW & central Asia display a steady increase, projected to reach close to 8K Ktons by 2050. In contrast, destinations like Canada, Mexico, and other regions such as Africa and Southeast Asia & Oceania show relatively stable trends with minor fluctuations. 
   </p>

   <p>
    <strong>5. Total Weight of Shipments by Domestic Destination and Year</strong><br>
    The graph shows a dramatic decrease from about 25K Ktons in 2018 to around 17K Ktons in 2025, indicating a significant drop in shipment volume during this period. Following this decline, the trend stabilizes and gradually begins to increase after 2030, with the total weight of shipments steadily climbing to approximately 19K Ktons by 2050. This trend suggests a period of adjustment or downturn in the early to mid-2020s, followed by a slow recovery or growth phase as the shipping volume increases toward the mid-21st century.

A prominent trend is observed in shipments to Europe which initially experiences a drop in 2020 but then shows a significant and steady rise, increasing from around 3,000 Ktons to nearly 6,000 Ktons by 2050. This suggests a growing demand for our expansion in trade activities within Europe over the period. Shipments to Eastern Asia and the Rest of Americas also depict growth, although more moderate compared to Europe, with Eastern Asia shipments rising above the Rest of Americas by 2050. Canada shows a consistent increase in shipment weight, indicating ongoing industrial or commercial growth. In contrast, other regions like Mexico and Africa show relatively stable and low shipment volumes, suggesting a slower pace of growth or lower levels of trade activity with these regions.
